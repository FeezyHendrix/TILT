IP: set of rules that dictate the format of data sent over a network, Identifies the node in a tcp/ip layer and use them to facilitate communication between nodes

Every Node in a network has an IP, in the packet header the IP of the origin node packets are included to know where its coming from and some protocol require an acknowledgement of successful delivery, thus the origin node IP can be used to send delivery confirmation.

IPv4 and IPv6 are two versions of IP address in public use.

Question: Are there any other public versions ?
Answer:  IPv4 an d IPv6 are the standard public IP addresses, while there are others like Mac Addresses, Private IP Addresses, APIPA(Automatic Private IP Addressing) and Link-Local Addresses.


IPv4 Is the fourth version of the Internal Protocol, They are 32-bit numbers arranged in four groups of 8 bits (called octets).

Network and Host IDS
Network ID inform routers when is the appropriate hop in the transmission of packets. They are link mail carriers in a network -> They determine where the data needs to be sent by examining the network ID of the destination address.

Once router has sent the data to the destination network, the router uses the host ID to deliver the data to the specific recipient.
