`BabeAuthorityWeight` is a component within the **BABE (Blind Assignment for Blockchain Extension)** consensus mechanism used by Substrate-based blockchains. It is one of the consensus algorithms used by the polkadot network and other substrate-based chains.

The algorithm focuses on block production, allowing multiples validators to produce blocks in a probabilistic manner. 

BabeAuthorityWeight represents the weight or staking power of a validator.
